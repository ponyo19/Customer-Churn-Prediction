# Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Introduction
This analysis and machine learning model aims to predict the likelihood of customer churn using Logistic Regression. This model promises to help businesses make better customer retention programs.

## Data
The data points of the problem represent the statistics of 7073 customers of  a fictional Telco company. The concerned label is whether the customer is going to cancel the service or not (1 for yes, 0 for no). The features include services that each customer has signed up for, customer account information, and demographic info about customers. 

The dataset was collected from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
A newer version of the dataset is also available from IBM: https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113

## Methodology
I performed feature engineering and feature selection and apply Logistic Regression to build the model.

## Result
The final model using Logistic Regression reaches an accuracy of approximately 79% on the test set.
